# Production VS Development mode

* Toggle configuration defaults using the `mode` property.
* **Development** configuration is optimized for speed.
* **Production** configuration means slower build, but it includes treeshaking, minification of code, safe source maps, etc.
* See more info at [webpack.js.org/configuration/mode](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/)
